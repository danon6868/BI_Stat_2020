## Survival analysis

In this project survival in a randomized trial comparing two treatments for ovarian cancer is analyzed (ovarian data set from package survival).

In the course of the mini-project following tasks were planned:

1. Describe data set and make EDA
2. Make Kaplanâ€“Meier curves
3. Estimate influence of different factor on survival rate
4. Analyze hazard factors and estimate hazard ratios

Detailed workflow including R code can be found in report in [rmd](https://github.com/danon6868/BI_Stat_2020/blob/main/project_survival/project_survival.Rmd) format.
