### Exploratory data analysis (EDA) <a name="eda"></a>

During this project, it was proposed to work with [data](https://github.com/danon6868/BI_Stat_2020/tree/main/project_eda/Data) about molluscs: their age, sex and different sizes. This data was collected by ten people and was located in different files.

The first thing to do was writing a custom function to merge these files and match the data with the tidy data confession. Then I made a short EDA, counted various descriptive statistics, compared some groups of mussels with each other, etc. A more detailed description of the tasks can be found [here](https://github.com/danon6868/BI_Stat_2020/blob/main/project_eda/Project_1.pdf). 

In the course of an additional part, I decided to look at how the person collecting the data affects the distribution of various variables. As a result, it turned out that often the sex and age composition of mollusks is very different in the data of different people. This could be associated with different places where the material was collected, but I did not have additional information.
